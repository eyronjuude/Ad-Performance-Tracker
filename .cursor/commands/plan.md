# Plan a feature or work breakdown

**Agent**: Use the **plan-agent**. Turn the user's request into a structured, actionable plan.

1. **Clarify** – What is being built? Scope, constraints, priorities?
2. **Decompose** – Split into discrete tasks; mark backend vs frontend.
3. **Order** – Identify dependencies; suggest execution order.
4. **Output** – Structured plan with checkboxes, dependencies, and unknowns.

Flag unknowns that need **researcher-agent** before implementation. Produce a plan ready to hand off to the implement command.

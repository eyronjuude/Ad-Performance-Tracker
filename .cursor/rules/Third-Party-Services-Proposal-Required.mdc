# Third-Party Services Require a Proposal

Before integrating any **third-party service** or **external API**, a proposal must be written and reviewed. This rule applies to services you call over the network, not to modules you install and import (see Prefer-Established-Modules).

**Scope**: External APIs, SaaS integrations, webhooks, payment gateways, authentication providers, maps, analytics, messaging services, and any other hosted service you call via HTTP/gRPC/WebSocket.

## Guidelines

- **Proposal required**: Every new third-party service integration must be accompanied by a proposal.
- **Before implementation**: Do not add integrations until the proposal is accepted.
- **Vet the service**: Only consider services with **good reputation** and **comprehensive documentation**. Prefer established vendors with strong track records, clear docs, and active support.
- **Proposal contents** should include:
  - Service name and vendor
  - Purpose and justification
  - Pricing and cost implications (if applicable)
  - Security and data handling (what data is sent where)
  - SLA, reliability, and vendor reputation
  - Documentation quality (API reference, guides, SDKs)
  - Alternatives considered and why this one was chosen
  - Plan for vendor lock-in mitigation if relevant

## Examples

```markdown
<!-- ❌ BAD - Implementing without a proposal -->
Integrating Stripe for payments. (Proceeding directly to code.)
```

```markdown
<!-- ✅ GOOD - Proposal first -->
## Proposal: Stripe for Payment Processing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Service | Stripe |
| Purpose | Accept card payments |
| Pricing | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |
| Data | PCI-compliant; card data never touches our servers |
| Reputation | Industry standard; SOC 2 Type II certified |
| Docs | Full API reference, SDKs, and integration guides |
| Alternatives | PayPal, Square — Stripe chosen for better DX |
```

## Workflow

1. Identify need for a third-party service.
2. Draft a proposal (per structure above).
3. Get proposal reviewed and approved.
4. Implement integration (URLs via env vars, secrets via env vars).
5. Document the integration.

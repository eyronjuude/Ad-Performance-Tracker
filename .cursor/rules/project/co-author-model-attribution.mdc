# Co-Author Model Attribution

Whenever an agent performs a Git commit, ensure that the commit footer always contains a `Co-authored-by` line for **every model** involved in the commit.

## Format

Use Git's standard co-author trailer format:

```text
Co-authored-by: Model Name <model@example.com>
```

- Add one line per model
- Place all co-author lines in the commit footer (after a blank line following the body)
- Include every AI model that contributed to the changes

## Example

```text
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint

Implements JWT-based login and token refresh.

Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-authored-by: Composer <noreply@cursor.com>
```

## Guidelines

- **Multiple models**: If more than one model contributed, list each on its own line
- **Blank line**: Always leave a blank line between the commit body and the footer
- **Full attribution**: Do not omit any model that contributed to the commit

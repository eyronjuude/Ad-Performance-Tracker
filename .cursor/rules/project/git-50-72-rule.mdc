# The 50/72 Rule of Git

Whenever creating commits, follow the 50/72 rule for commit message formatting.

## Rules

1. **50-character subject line**: Keep the subject line (first line) to **50 characters or fewer**. Summarize the change concisely.
2. **72-character body lines**: If the commit has a body, wrap each line at **72 characters**. Improves readability in terminals and web UIs.

## Format

```text
Subject line (≤50 characters)

Body line 1 (each line ≤72 characters)
Body line 2...
```

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Strive to explain *why* the change was made, not just *what*
- Reference work items, tickets, or issues when relevant

## Examples

```text
# BAD - Subject too long
feat(api): add comprehensive user authentication with OAuth2 and session management

# GOOD - Subject ≤50 chars
feat(api): add user auth with OAuth2 and sessions

# BAD - Body line too long
This commit adds a new endpoint for fetching campaign analytics data with support for date range filtering and aggregation.

# GOOD - Body lines ≤72 chars
This commit adds a new endpoint for fetching campaign analytics
data with support for date range filtering and aggregation.
```

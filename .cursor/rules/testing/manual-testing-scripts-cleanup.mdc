# Manual Testing Scripts Cleanup

When the user asks for **manual testing** and the agent creates new scripts (e.g., shell scripts, one-off Python/Node scripts) to perform that testing, **delete those scripts as soon as execution completes**.

## Guidelines

- **Scope**: Applies only to scripts the agent creates specifically to run manual tests—not to existing project test scripts or fixtures.
- **Timing**: Remove the script immediately after it has finished running (success or failure).
- **Do not leave**: Avoid leaving temporary or throwaway scripts in the repo once the manual test is done.

## Examples

```
<!-- User: "Can you do some manual testing on the campaigns API?" -->
<!-- Agent creates scripts/test_campaigns_manual.sh, runs it, verifies output -->
<!-- Agent deletes scripts/test_campaigns_manual.sh before responding -->
```

```
<!-- User: "Manually test the health endpoint" -->
<!-- Agent creates scripts/check_health.py, runs it -->
<!-- Agent deletes scripts/check_health.py immediately after -->
```

## Checklist

1. Created a script for manual testing? → Note its path.
2. Script execution finished? → Delete the script.
3. Report results to user without leaving the script behind.
